# PassportGlobal

## How it works

Bootsrapped with [Optimism Starter Kit](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-starter).

To run this locally you need to create `.env` file by copying `.env.example` file and set values for the environment variables there.

In addition to standard environment variables which was derived from the Optimism Started Ket you need to provide Google Maps API key with permission to the following APIs:

- Maps API
- Places API
- Geocoding API

NOTE: Google Maps API key will be available for a general public, so the API key access must be restricted via Google Developer Console (e.g. by IP address or website domain name).
